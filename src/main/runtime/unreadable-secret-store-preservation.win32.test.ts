/**
 * What a *successful* harden does to a reader that cannot read.
 *
 * Path hardening writes a protected DACL granting only the SIDs the running process holds. Where
 * the data root came from somewhere else — a relocated `ORCA_USER_DATA_PATH`, a share, a roaming
 * profile, a backup restored under a recreated local account, or a harden whose `/reset` landed
 * and whose grant did not — the file ends up granting a SID this process does not have. It then
 * reads as `EPERM` while its *directory* stays writable, because file hardening is synchronous on
 * the write path and directory hardening is fire-and-forget.
 *
 * Every store below used to treat any read failure as "malformed — regenerate", and the
 * regeneration succeeds: `renameSync` over an unreadable file needs `FILE_DELETE_CHILD` on the
 * parent, not `DELETE` on the file. So the healing path destroyed the thing it could not read.
 * Before hardening actually applied, this failed open — the file was simply readable.
 *
 * These assert the file is still the same, untouched inode afterwards. Runs only on win32, where a
 * DACL is the mechanism; skipped elsewhere.
